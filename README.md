## Welcome to Our Project
The theme of the NYU Tandon HAQathon is sustainbility, and we are proud to be one of the seven teams this fall. At NYU, we value sustainbility, not as a slogan, but as our mission. Together, we wanted to build a tool that address sustainbility while using knowledge from both classical and quantum computing to reduce carbon footprint and improve efficiency. We depend heavily on public transport at new york city, but many times due to outdated designs, the public transport system requires a far longer route than the linear distance to the destination. We attempt to use quantum computing optimization techniques to simulate a path for future applications.


introducing Qpath_optimizer, a path finding algorithm that uses optimizations to obtain the best result.
This tool utilizes open source data from NYC to generate data sets for calculation.
The links to our source data is below:

Population Density: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/census-api-by-coordinates

All NYC subway stations: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/Subway-Stations/arq3-7z49

Qpath-optimizer uses quantum optimization techniques to provide an advantage in computing resource usage. Specifically, Qpath_optimizer uses Quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) and Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), and materials we referenced to is linked below:

Further Optimizing with VQE: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhEnvYgoA34

This projects aims to save valuable time for future planning and can be generalized to many optimization problems. In specific, new subway route planning and water distribution.

Details on technical information and navigating through the code file is documented below.

## Frontend Discription
// add info here

## Backend Discription
### [Data](https://github.com/grid-rider/Qpath_optimizer/tree/dev/backend/data)
"Data" is a folder than contains all the data sets we accessed from open data sites.

### [PathFinder.py](https://github.com/grid-rider/Qpath_optimizer/blob/dev/backend/map.py)
"map.py" process the raw data and turns matrices of different purposes for later usage.

### [PathFinder.py](https://github.com/grid-rider/Qpath_optimizer/blob/dev/backend/graph.py)
"graph.py" takes the data sets generated by "map.py" and further completes the graph needed. In which vertices will be connected with edges.

### [PathFinder.py](https://github.com/grid-rider/Qpath_optimizer/blob/dev/backend/PathFinder.py)
"PathFinder.py" imports data structures and maps created by "graph.py" and "map.py" to construct the best path between two points entered by the user. PathFinder is the backbone of the entire backend algorithms as it manages the cost of each vertex using classical computing and utilize quantum computations to return the final result as a list of points.
