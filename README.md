## Welcome to Our Project
Qpath_optimizer is path finding algorithm that uses optimizations for the best result.
This tool utilizes open source data from NYC to generate data sets for calculation.
The links to our source data is below:

Population Density: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/census-api-by-coordinates

All NYC subway stations: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/Subway-Stations/arq3-7z49

Qpath-optimizer uses quantum optimization techniques to provide an advantage in computing resource usage. Specifically, Qpath_optimizer uses Quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) and Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), and materials we referenced to is linked below:

Shortest path with quantum annealer: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9186612

Further Optimizing with VQE: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhEnvYgoA34

This projects aims to save valuable time for future planning and can be generalized to many optimization problems. In specific, new subway route planning and water distribution.

Details on technical information and navigating through the code file is documented below.
